\section{Introduction}
Gold nanoparticles exhibit enhanced absoprtion and scattering cross sections
ranging from the visible to the near infra red. This property is closely related
to the surface plasmon (i.e. a collective oscilation of conduction electrons)
that in turn depends on the shape of the particles. For the case of gold
nanorods (AuNR) its surface plasmon resonance (SPR) energy depends on the aspect
ratio (AR) of the particle and can be found between $2.3\,\textrm{eV}$ for
spheres (AR of $1$) to even below $0.8\,\textrm{eV}$ for very elongated
particles.

Many experiments that span from biosensing \cite{Zijlstra2012} to photodynamic
therapy \cite{Zhao2014} and plasmon-enhanced spectroscopies \cite{Sivapalan2013}
highly depend on the position of the plasmon resonance. Usually this is done at
the moment of synthesis \cite{Gou2005}, by controlling the concentrations of
growth and seed solutions. In this way is possible to induce the formation of
longer or shorter particles \cite{Nikoobakht2003}. This methods however, always
present a dispersion in the size distribution of the outcome, hindering the
repeatability and the ability to build larger, periodic structures. Often an
after-synthesis procedure is needed to achieve the needed parameters.

Tuning the plasmon peak position after the synthesis has been object of several
studies in the past. One of the possibilities is to achieve thermal reshaping
that can be induced by illuminating the nanoparticles with an intense, pulsed
laser\cite{Link2000}\cite{Horiguchi2008}. Chemical reshaping is also possible
and was also the focus of several studies\cite{Yuan2015}
\cite{Carbo-Argibay2007} \cite{Rodriguez-Fernandez2005} \cite{Jana2002}. In all
these works a particular interest was put into the surfactant employed to avoid
the aggregation of the particles. The coating of the surface will modify the
heat transfer from gold to the medium (for the thermal reshaping) and will cause
that the reactivity of the sides and tips of the particles to be different (for
the chemical reshaping). This automatically leads to an anisotropic reshaping,
shortening the long axis or softening any high-curvature region. Moreover, all
the cited experiments are performed bulk samples of nanorods in suspension.
Single-particle experiments are however scarce.

Another group has studied how the chemical reactivity of gold \cite{Ni2012} can
be altered by exploiting the plasmon resonance. This is achieved mainly through
changes in the surrounding temperature; it has to be noted that in these
experiments the surfactant was present as for the bulk experiments. In another
work\cite{Tsung2006}, high resolution TEM images allowed to show that the
crystal structure of individual particles is preserved after oxidation that
induces a shortening of the long axis of over $10\,\textrm{nm}$. A common trend
in the vast majority of these works is that nanorods tend to reshape into
spheres, giving rise to a blue shift of the longitudinal plasmon resonance.

The abundance of works in these topic is a good indication of the importance of
having methods for altering the nanoparticle shape (and therefore their plasmon
resonance) after the synthesis. It can also be stated that the next logical step
into the characterization of these methods are the single-particle studies and
the removal of the surfactant from the process. In this work we propose a
chemical etching strategy that allows the in-\textit{situ} control of the
plasmon resonance of single gold nanorods immobilized on a glass surface.

We employ KCN as an etching agent; a known and well understood compound that is
used not only in the nano-industry but also at bigger scales, for instance for
gold mining. It's overall reaction formula is:
\begin{equation*}
4\textrm{Au} + 8\textrm{KCN}^-+\textrm{O}_2 + 2\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}
\leftrightarrows 4K\textrm{Au(CN)}_2^-+4\textrm{KOH}^-
\end{equation*}
In bulk this compound was used for reducing the aspect ratio of rods, i.e.
blue shifting their plasmon \cite{Jana2002}. In a more recent paper it was also
used for generating highly spherical particles with a narrow size
distribution \cite{Lee2013}. 

In our single-particle experiments of the AuNR show that by this reaction, it is
possible to red-shift the plasmon resonance peak in more than
$300\,\textrm{meV}$ (roughly $100\,\textrm{nm}$ for particles starting with a
SRP at $650\,\textrm{nm}$) without degrading the shape or the optical properties
of the nanorods, i.e. the rods preserve the rod-like geometry during the process
and the FWHM of the peak follows the expected behaviour.

The preservation of the shape of the particles is confirmed by tracking the
luminescence spectra of individual rods over time while the reactions is
happening as well as by acquiring SEM images of the particles at defined
intervals of the process. A simple model where etching is considered as being
isotropic and constant (i.e. both the radius of the particle and it's length
diminish at the same rate over time), yields a good agreement with both the
plasmon shift and the changes observed in the FWHM. 

Our experiments are new in performing both single-particle studies while
removing the surfactant from the equation. Controlling the concentration of KCN
allows to fine tune the plasmon peak position of individual particles, without
hindering the known optical properties of them. Moreover we show that only a few
thousand molecules of KCN have to react with the nanoparticle in order to have
an observable change in the plasmon position.

\section{Experimental method}
The luminescence spectra of single gold nanorods (AuNR) is acquired in a home
built confocal microscope using an Acton 500i Spectrometer. A $532\,\textrm{nm}$
laser is used for exciting the particles with a power in the back focal plane of
of the objective of $300\,\mu\textrm{W}$. A high NA objective (Olympus $60$X NA
$1.4$ Oil immersion) is used for both focusing the laser and collecting the
luminescence. A $532\,\textrm{nm}$ notch filter cuts out the excitation light.

The samples are prepared by spin casting a suspension of AuNR on clean
coverslips and thoroughly rinsing them  with Milli-Q water and placed in an
ozone cleaner for eliminating the excess of CTAB. The samples are then placed in
a flowcell; the initial spectra are taken with the rods immersed in Milli-Q
water. This characterization allows to discard, for instance, clusters of rods.
After this, a solution of KCN is flowed into the cell with concentrations
ranging from $3\mu\textrm{M}$ to $80\mu\textrm{M}$. Then the spectra of
approximately $10$ different particles is acquired consecutively after focusing
in each one. The time resolution varies according to the exposure time and
number of particles; in this work a spectra of each particle is taken at least
every minute.

For confirming the preservation of the shape of the particles after the
dissolution in KCN, SEM images are acquired. The samples are prepared by letting
a droplet of a suspension of AuNR dry on top of a silicon wafer and then
thoroughly rinsing them with Milli-Q water for eliminating the excess of CTAB.
The same samples are employed for taking images before and after immersing the
particles in $30\mu\textrm{M}$ KCN. For the analysis only the rods separated
from each other are considered as to reproduce the conditions found in the
optical experiment. After immersing the samples in KCN for a given period of
time, they are rinsed with water to stop the reaction and dried with a nitrogen
flow.

Bulk extinction spectra of the suspension of rods used previously is acquired as
a function of time after a solution of KCN is added into the vial. This allows
to compare single-particle experiments with previous results.

 interval between peaks is $70s$. The inset shows the peak position of the SPR as a

 \label{fig:plasmon_single_rod}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_single_rod} shows the typical red-shift of the
longitudinal plasmon of a single rod while immersed in $20\,\mu\textrm{M}$ KCN.
Each curve is the luminescence spectra of the same rod displayed at intervals of
$70\,s$ between each other; the small shoulder at $1.9\,\textrm{eV}$
($650\,\textrm{nm}$) that can be observed for the less intense curves is due to
Raman scattering of water that was not completely removed when subtracting the
background to these curves. The inset shows the peak position (calculated by
fitting the spectra with a lorentzian) over time. The plasmon red-shifts over
$0.25\,\textrm{eV}$ ($100\,\textrm{nm}$) in $5$ minutes. This same trend is
observed for all the rods in similar conditions.

 \caption{Average plasmon shift (thick line) for 9 rods due to the etching with
 $20\mu M$ KCN. The light curves are individual time traces while the thick one
 is the average. The error bars are simply the standard deviation at each point. Over
 time the peak distribution gets broader.}
 \label{fig:plasmon_average}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_average} shows the behaviour of the plasmon peak
position for nine different rods while being etched with $20\,\mu\textrm{M}$
KCN. The pale lines show each individual trace, while the darker is the average.
The error bars are the standard deviation of the distribution at each point.
Since spectra of different particles are taken at slightly different times (one
after the other), an interpolation with cubic splines is used for calculating
the average and the standard deviation at the given times. The bigger time step
between $225\,\textrm{s}$ and $340\,\textrm{s}$ is due to an automatic
refocusing happening on the particles every $5$ minutes. The plasmon shift of
each particle ranges between $0.05\,\textrm{eV}$ and $0.35\,\textrm{eV}$ in over
$9$ minutes. The dispersion of the rate change can be attributed to different
initial aspect ratios.

 \caption{Different peak position shift rates as a function of initial plasmon
 peak position.}
 \label{fig:shift-vs-spr}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:shift-vs-spr} shows the plasmon shift rate as a function of the
initial plasmon peak position while immersed in $20\,\mu\textrm{M}$ KCN. The
shift rate is extracted by a linear fit of the curves in Figure
\ref{fig:plasmon_average}. The Figure shows a clear trend in which particles
with lower aspect ratios (higher resonance energies) have a slower shift rate.
The proposed model of isotropic etching fits this scenario, since particles
closer to spheres change their aspect ratio much slower while reducing their
axes at the same rate. Extracting the FWHM of each peak allows to determine that
the optical and geometrical quality of the particles are being preserved during
the experiment.

 \caption{Plasmon FWHM of eight different particles immersed in $20\,\mu M$ KCN
 as a function of their plasmon shift. The inset shows the results from the
 simulations carried on with the ADDA package.}
 \label{fig:FWHM}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:FWHM} shows how the FWHM of the plasmon decreases while the
shift increases. At the beginning of the reaction there is a rapid diminishing
of the width, probably due to the elimination of defects from the surface of the
particles. Then a minimum is reached for shifts between $0.15\,\textrm{eV}$ and
$0.20\,\textrm{eV}$. This decrease is explainable thinking that the higher
energy distance between the longitudinal plasmon peak and interband transitions
in gold makes less efficient the non radiative damping mechanisms in the
particles, hence yielding a narrower resonance as was already observed in other
studies\cite{Sonnichsen2002}. While the reaction continues, the width starts to
increase; this means that the reshaping at some point will start having an
effect on the shape of the particle and because of the reduction in particle
volume, other dephasing effects may start being relevant (for instance, surface
scattering). This is often encountered for shifts above $0.15\,textrm{eV}$, but
depends on the particle initial size and shape. Further simulations are needed
in order to test the hypothesis of the isotropic etching of the nanoparticles.

Simulations are performed using the discrete dipole approximation with the ADDA
package\cite{Yurkin2011}. The initial dimensions are
$25\textrm{nm}\times60\textrm{nm}$ which coincide with the median dimensions of
the distribution of sizes of the nanoparticles. These simulations are carried on
in steps of $0.5\,\textrm{nm}$ for a total of $10\textrm{nm}$ (i.e. the minimum
particle size is $15\textrm{nm}\times 50 \textrm{nm}$). The results are
displayed as the red curve in Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_average}. The best
approximation to the average is found when the etching rate is set to
$1\,\textrm{nm}/min$. Furthermore the simulations provide insight into the width
of the plasmon peak.

The inset in Figure \ref{fig:FWHM} shows the results of the
ADDA\cite{Yurkin2011} simulations for a $25x60$nm particle while both its axis
diminish evenly. The initial FWHM is $0.14\,\textrm{eV}$, slightly lower than
the experimentally obtainable. This is due to particles not having a perfect rod
shape or because of defects on their surface. The calculated width however
diminishes to $0.1\,\textrm{eV}$ for shifts of just under $0.2\,\textrm{eV}$ as
it is observed experimentally. This two results already show an agreement
between a model of isotropic etching and our experimental results, and can be
further confirmed by SEM images of the rods at different stages of the process.

Samples of the same nanorods are prepared for SEM imaging as described earlier.
The images are acquired before the etching, after $2\,\textrm{min}$ submersed in
KCN and after $4\,\textrm{min}$. When particles are isolated from each other,
the model of the isotropic etching seems appropriate, as the shape is preserved.
It has to be noted, however, that for aggregates of particles this no longer
holds, and rods start to loose their shape (see Supporting Information for SEM
images.) Calculating the distribution of sizes of the particles shows a slight
increase in the aspect ratio but this is however obscured by the broad
distribution of values (even before starting the etching). Averaging around
$300$ different particles at each interval yields an etching constant of
$0.5\,\textrm{nm}/\min$, consistent with the optical observations, not only of
the plasmon shift but also of the diminishing intensity as a function of time. 

It is a known result that the cross section of the particle is proportional to
its volume. Therefore a reduction of size will yield a reduction in intensity as
is observed in all the performed experiments and simulations. Considering an
atomic radius of gold of $144\,\textrm{pm}$(From Wikipedia. Better source?) the
findings show an average etching rate of $1500$ atoms per second. The same trend 
can also be observed for different concentrations of KCN, and therefore the
number of reacting atoms per unit of time can also be changed.

\begin{figure}[p]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{shift_different_concentrations.png}
 \caption{Plasmon shift for particles with a similar inital SPR at different
 concentrations of KCN. The shift rate is proportional to the concentration.}
 \label{fig:shift_concentration}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:shift_concentration} shows the plasmon peak shift as a function
of KCN concentration for particles with a plasmon peak position of roughly
$1.97\,\textrm{eV}$ ($630\,\textrm{nm}$). At each KCN concentration between $9$
and $15$ particles are studied. From each study, those with an initial plasmon
close to the reference energy are selected to avoid the dependency with the
initial aspect ratio as was shown in Figure \ref{fig:shift-vs-spr}. The
timetraces of the peak position clearly show that the shift rate is proportional
to the concentration of KCN. This is shown in the inset, where the shift rate is
defined as previously (Figure \ref{fig:shift-vs-spr}). 

From these results and adapting the model it is possible to establish that the
reaction rate can be as low as $700$ atoms per second for a KCN concentration of
$10\mu M$. In the experiments performed at $3\mu M$ concentration the particles
chosen didn't have a plasmon close to $1.97\,\textrm{eV}$ and therefore are not
shown; if the extrapolation still holds true it would yield a rate of just $200$
atoms per second. Inverting the relationship, the plasmon peak shift while gold
reacts with KCN happens at a rate of roughly $0.5\cdot
10^{-6}\,\textrm{eV}/\textrm{atom}$.

Every particle can be slightly different from another, not only because of its
aspect ratio (and plasmon peak position) but also because of the presence of
surface impurities. This was shown already in Figure \ref{fig:FWHM} where the
FWHM decreases steeply at the beginning. The distribution of particle sizes and
aspect ratios will in turn lead to different shift rates that will cause a
broadening of the peak distribution after etching. These results are for
particles immobilized on the coverslip and with all the surface capping washed
out, leading to an isotropic etching. In bulk, where the rods are freely
difussing and the surfactant is still present, the results are different.

 indicates the time evolution. A solution of KCN is added into the cuvette with
 the nanorod suspension as to have a $50\,\mu M$ concentration for the first 9
 minutes; then this step is repeated, yielding a final KCN concentration of
 $100\, \mu M$. The inset shows the peak position of the SPR position as a
 function of time, extracted by fitting the spectra with a lorentzian.  }
 \label{fig:bulk}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:bulk} shows a blue-shift of the longitudinal plasmon peak for a
suspension of rods while being etched with KCN; these results were already
reported in several works and under different
conditions\cite{Rodriguez-Fernandez2005}\cite{Tsung2006}\cite{Jana2002}. The
spectra is plotted at intervals of $9$ minutes after adding a solution of KCN
that results in a concentration of $100\mu\textrm{M}$ in the vial. All spectra
plots are normalized to the transverse plasmon peak at $2.4\,\textrm{eV}$ for increasing
the visibility of the longitudinal plasmon shift. These results are strikingly
different from the single-particle measurements and can be explained by the
protective bilayer of CTAB present.

The plasmon peak position shifts towards higher energies (from approximately
$2.0\,\textrm{eV}$ to $2.1\,\textrm{eV}$ or equivalently from $620\,\textrm{nm}$
to $592\,\textrm{nm}$). It means that the rods are reshaping into spheres as was
previously observed \cite{Jana2002}. This implies that the tips of the rods are
more exposed to KCN than the sides as is expected from the their higher
curvature\cite{Yuan2015}. 

The presence of the surface is another aspect that may explain the difference
between the bulk and single-particle results. The surface would prevent the
reaction of gold with KCN from happening on one of the sides of the rods. By
definition this implies a non-isotropic model. On the other hand it would also
imply that the shape of the rods is not preserved since they would get
flattened. If this would be the case, the FWHM of the rods is expected to
increase but it is not the case, at least for the first couple hundreds
$\textrm{meV}$ of shift. The SEM images does not allow to assess this question
because there is no information on the third axis (perpendicular to the
surface). Experiments performed in an optical tweezer away from the surface as
done in Ref \cite{Ni2012} but without the capping agent would involve in
addition the use of microfluidics and therefore are much harder to perform.


%The same behaviour is observed for rods immersed in different concentrations of
%KCN, a red shift that can be of up to $100\,\textrm{nm}$. However the rate at
%which the plasmon shifts is different for different particles, as can already
%% be seen in Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_average}. It is expected that bigger
%% particles
%show a slower plasmon shift since the aspect ratio changes more slowly when
%reducing the axis length. For instance, a reduction of $1\,\textrm{nm}$ for a
%particle with axis $12.5\textrm{nm}\times30\textrm{nm}$ changes the aspect
%% ratio from  $2.40$ to $2.52$, while for a $25\textrm{nm}\times60\textrm{nm}$
%% the shift
%is to $2.46$. However there is no correlation between the initial brightness
%(proportional to the volume) and the observed rate. Different initial aspect
%ratios may also show different rates, but again no correlation is observed.
%% This means that there is an intrinsic property of the particles that makes
%% them react
%slower or faster with KCN. This is also confirmed by SEM images, since the
%distribution of longitudinal and transverse axis get broader over time.


%This can be further confirmed by SEM images of the rods.

%The study of the FWHM of the peak allows to confirm that during this process
% the optical properties of the plasmon do not get dampened.
%The red curve in the Figure is the result of the simulations that best fit the
%experimental results.

\section{Conclusions}
In this work we have shown a simple method that allows the tuning of the plasmon
peak position of single gold nanorods with nanometer accuracy and over the range
of $300\,\textrm{meV}$ ($100\,\textrm{nm}$). More importantly, it is shown that
the rodlike shape is preserved for these shifts and therefore the well known
optical properties of the nano particles are not dampened. Moreover the absense
of the capping agent also works in favor of the proposed mechanisms in previous
works.

The experiments allow to record the plasmon peak with a relatively high temporal
and spectral accuracy, allowing to stop the reaction when the resonance is at
the desired value. Both SEM images and the study of the FWHM of the longitudinal
resonance allow to confirm that the shape of the rods is being preserved. The
agreement between the simulations assuming an isotropic etching and the
experimental results not only show the link between both measurements but also
provide a way of predicting the behaviour of the plasmon peak for different
rods.

It is also found a great distribution of the rate at which the plasmon peak
shifts for different particles under the same experimental conditions. This can
be attributed to the initial aspect ratios of each particle. Sphere-like
particles will show a small shift due to the fact that the aspect ratio is
constant while under isotropic etching. The more elongated particles, on the
other hand, will have a much steeper increase in aspect ratio while being
etched. The majority of the rods present in the samples studied belong to an
intermediate position, with their resonance at $1.90\,\textrm{eV}$ (aspect ratio
of $2.4$)

% only considering that there is an intrinsic difference between particles; this
% differences can be attributed to defects on the particle surface or to
% inhomogeneities in the left over CTAB capping the rods even if care is taken to
% remove it by rinsing with water. Different initial conditions (such as initial
% aspect ratio or volume) are considered but no correlation with the rate of the
% shift is observed. This doesn't discard any relationship between them as there
% can be an interwined dependence on both initial size and aspect ratio.
% Experiments on larger ensembles of particles would increase the possibility of
% finding more nanorods with the same initial conditions.

The role of the capping agent has largely been studied and has always been held
responsible for the observations both in chemical etching\cite{Yuan2015} and for
photothermal reshaping\cite{Horiguchi2008}. Avoiding the presence of the
passivating layers is impossible in suspension, since gold nanoparticles would
aggregate. Our results do not only provide a method for changing the plasmon
resonance after the synthesis and in-situ, but also provide evidence that
supports previous observations regarding the effect of the curvature and the
accessibility of KCN to the surface of the particle. We also show that
single-particle experiments open new ways of controlling the particle shape.

A simple approximation of the reaction rates show that the dissolution of just a
few thousand atoms in the gold nanoparticle are enough for detecting a change in the
luminescence spectra. This method is not aimed at pushing the detection limits
of KCN (or other substances) via plasmonic structures, but still has proven to
be highly efficient. A better approach to sense plasmon shifts is to detect
changes in the cross section at the plasmon wing (via scattering or
photothermal detection, for instance). 

The report by Wei et Al. in 2012 \cite{Wei2012} shows these ideas but in a
slightly different condition. They found sensitivities to the presence of KCN in
the order of the nM. We have readily approached this threshold and believe that
the sensitivity of single particles to very low concentrations (in the order or
below the nM) should be higher, specially if using smaller particles with a
higher aspect ratio.

Combining this results with the catalytic properties of gold and the presence of
the plasmon resonance opens the door for fine-controlling chemical reactions
while irradiating the particles with specific wavelengths. Using a compound with
a lower reactivity with gold would allow to compare the difference of reaction
rates while exciting or not the longitudinal plasmon and are already a work in
progress in our lab.
