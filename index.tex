\section{Introduction}
Gold Nanorods (AuNR) are employed in a variety of fields, ranging from solar
cells production\cite{Catchpole:08} to biosensing. These nanoparticles exhibit a
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), i.e. a collective oscillation of the
conduction electrons, that is related to their aspect ratio (AR); spherical
particles (AR=$1$) have the plasmon peak at around $540nm$ while rods can be
tuned to have it even above $900nm$. This tuning is usally done at the time of
the synthesis by varying the concentration of seed and grow solutions. However,
even in the best case, every sample will show a dispersion of both shapes and 
plasmon peak positions. 

Tuning the resonance of plasmonic structures after the synthesis of the
particles and moreover after fixing them on a substrate are of great interest
for a diversity of experiments where, for instance, there is the need of
overlapping the particle spectra with a fluorophore or with the wavelenght of
the available lasers.

This work focus in the employment of KCN as an etching agent that will allow to
fine-tune the plasmon peak position. The overall reaction can be written as 

\begin{equation}
4\textrm{Au} + 8\textrm{KCN}^-+\textrm{O}_2 + 2\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}
\leftrightarrows 4\textrm{Au(CN)}_2^-+4\textrm{KOH}^-
\end{equation}

In bulk this compound is used for reducing the aspect ratio of the rods, i.e.
blue shifting their plasmon. In a more recent paper it was also used for
generating highly spherical particles with a narrow size distribution. 

In this work the opposite trend is observed. Single-particle experiments of the
AuNR immersed in KCN show a red-shift of the plasmon meaning an increase in
aspect ratio. This is confirmed by tracking the spectra of individual rods over
time as well as by acquiring SEM images of them. A simple model where etching is
considered as being isotropic and constant, this means that both the radius of
the particle and it's length diminish at the same rate over time, yields a high
agreement with both sets of experiments. 

\section{Experimental method}
Two kind of experiments are carried on; the first will be called the optical
experiment and consists of acquiring the luminescence spectra of single gold
nanorods (AuNR) in a home built confocal microscope using an Acton 500i
Spectrometer. For exciting the particles a $532nm$ laser is used with a power
in the back focal plane of $300\mu W$. A high NA objective (Olympus $60X NA 1.4$
Oil immersion) is used for both focusing the laser and collecting the
luminescence. A $532nm$ notch filter is used for cutting out the excitation.

The samples are prepared by spin casting a suspention of AuNR on a clean
coverslip and thoroughsly rinsing them  with milli-Q water for eliminating the
excess of CTAB. The samples are then placed in a flowcell; the initial spectra
are taken with the rods immersed in Milli-Q water. After this, a solution of
KCN is flowed into the cell with concentrations ranging from $3\mu M$ to $50\mu
M$. Then the spectra of approximately $10$ different particles is
acquired by consecutively focusing in each one. The time resolution varies
according to the exposure time and number of particles; in this case a spectra
is taken at least every minute.

The second kind of experiments are performed in an SEM. The samples
are prepared by letting a droplet of a suspension of AuNR dry on top of a
silicon waffer and then thoroughlsy rinsing them with water for eliminating the
excess of CTAB. The same samples are employed for taking images before and after
immersing the particles in $30\mu M$ KCN. Particular care is taken in having the
rods separated from each other as to reproduce the conditions found in the
optical experiment. After immersing the samples in KCN for a given period of
time, they are rinsed with water to stop the reaction and dried with a nitrogen
flow.

\section{Results and discussion}
As stated before two experiments are performed, the first in a
confocal microscope and the second in an SEM. These findings are compared to
numerical simulations using the discrete dipole approximation. The first set of
experiments allows to have a high temporal resolution, at the same time that
following the plasmon peak and shape of several AuNR. The second experiment, on
the other hand, allows to gain insight into the real shape of rods in exchange
of a lower temporal resolution.

 interval between peaks is $70s$. The inset shows the peak position of the SPR as a
 function of time, extracted by fitting the spectra with a Lorenzian.}
 \label{fig:plasmon_single_rod}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_single_rod} shows the typical behavior of the plasmon of
a single rod while immersed in $30\mu M$ KCN. The Figure shows the acquired
spectra with an interval of $70s$ while the inset shows the peak position
(calculated by fitting the spectra with a lorentzian) over time. It can be seen
that the plasmon red-shifts over $100\, nm$ ($0.25\, eV$) in $5$ minutes. The
diminishing intensity is consistent with the volume loss given by the
dissolution of gold. In this case only one rod is observed therefore having a
higher temporal resolution, but exactly the same trend was observed for each
single nanorod analyzed.

\begin{figure}[htb]

 \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{plasmon_average.eps}
 \caption{Average plasmon shift for 9 rods due to the etching with $30\mu M$
 KCN. The light curves are individual timetraces while the thick one is the
 average. The error bars are simply the standard deviation at each point. Over
 time the peak distribution gets broader.}
 \label{fig:plasmon_average}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_average} shows the timetraces of the peak positions of
$9$ different rods while being etched with $30\mu M$ KCN. The pale lines show
each individual trace, while the darker is the average. The error bars are simply the
standard deviation of the distribution at each point. The bigger time step
between $225s$ and $340s$ is due to an automatic refocusing happening on the
particles every $5\textrm{min}$. 

This exact same trend is observed for every particle at different KCN
concentrations. The broadening of the distribution is also observed and has to
be attributed to intrinsic inhomogenities in the particles since it is not
possible to find a trend in the shift rate nor with the initial particle 
volume nor to the initial peak position. 
% How can this be explained????

Figure \ref{fig:SEM_30muM} shows three SEM images for a sample of the same
nanorods used in the optical experiment before the etching, after $2min$
submersed in KCN and after $4min$. Table \ref{tab:SEM_results} summarizes the
averaged values found after analyzing approximately $300$ particles. It is
possible to observe that the AuNR preserve the shape while diminishing the
volume and increasing the aspect ratio. Nevertheless this changes are
inside the standard distribution of each parameter. Because of how the
experiments are performed tracking a single-particle in the SEM is not
possible. However the broadening of the distribution is consistent with the
optical results and can be therefore used as a reference for the average
behavior.

 $4min$ & $49$ & $5$ & $22$ & $2$ \\
\label{tab:SEM_results}

\end{tabular*}



To link both results it is possible to calculate the plasmon peak position
together with the size of the particle by using the discrete dipole
approximation. According to the observations in the SEM experiments, it
is possible to assume an isotropic etching, i.e. both radius and length
diminish at the same rate, and in this particular case it is at around
$0.5\,nm/min$. In Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_average} the red line shows the
result from the simulation. It can be seen that it falls into the distribution
of the plasmon peak positions.

\section{Conclusions}
In this work it is shown a simple method that allows the tuning of the plasmon
peak position of a single gold nanorod with nanometer accuracy. More
importantly, it is shown that the rodlike shape is preserved even for plasmon
shifts of approximately $80nm$ therefore keeping the well known properties of
them.

The optical experiments show the red-shift of the plasmon with a high time
accuracy, while with the SEM it is possible to confirm that the shape of the
rods is being preserved. The agreement between the simulations and the
experimental results not only show the link between both measurments but also
provide a way of predicting the behaviour of the plasmon peak. 

However, it is also found a great distribution width at the rate plasmon shifts
for different particles under the same experimental conditions. This can be
explained only considering that there is an intrinsic difference between
particles; this differences can be attributed to defects on the particle surface
or to inhomogenities in the CTAB present; even if care is taken to remove it
by rinsing with water it may be that some remains sticked to the particle.

Combining this results with the catalytic properties of gold and the presence of
the plasmon resonance opens the door for fine-controlling chemical reactions
while irradiating the particles with specific wavelengths.
