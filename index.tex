\section{Introduction}

Gold nanoparticles exhibit enhanced absorption and scattering cross sections
ranging from the visible to the near infra red. This property is closely related
to the surface plasmon (i.e. a collective oscillation of conduction electrons)
that in turn depends on the shape of the particles. For the case of gold
nanorods (AuNR) their surface plasmon resonance (SPR) energy depends on the
aspect ratio (AR) of the particle and can be found between $550\nm$ for
spheres (AR of $1$) to even above $800\nm$ for very elongated
particles.

The surface plasmon presents great opportunities in (bio-)
sensing\cite{Zijlstra2012}, enhanced spectroscopies\cite{Sivapalan2013},
photothermal therapy\cite{Zhao2014}, and concentrating light below the
diffraction limit\cite{Zijlstra2011}. Success in many of these applications
requires precise and in situ control over the nanoparticles' plasmon resonance
energy. For example, maximum fluorescence\cite{Khatua2014} or Raman
enhancement\cite{McFarland2005} is achieved when the nanoparticle's plasmon
resonance is tuned to excitation laser wavelength or efficient photothermal
therapy requires nanoparticles' SPR to be tuned to NIR to minimize the damage to
healthy cells\cite{Alkilany2012}.

Typically, SPR is tuned by carefully manipulating the shapes of nanoparticles
during their synthesis. Particularly useful are the rod-shaped particles, whose
resonance can be tuned from $600\nm$ to over $1000\nm$ by changing their aspect
ratios through carefully adjusting the concentrations of gold-seed and silver
nitrate during the seed-mediated growth synthesis method\cite{Vigderman2012}.
Many other nanoparticles shapes, such as nanoprisms, nanorice, nanocubes,
nanoshells, etc. have been synthesized with their plasmon resonances covering
entirely the spectral range from visible to near-IR\cite{West2003}. Wet-chemical
synthesis methods, however, generally yield a broad distribution in
nanoparticles sizes and/or shapes, which hinders precise and reproducible tuning
of nanoparticles SPR. Furthermore these methods do not provide any in-situ
adjustment of SPR; any change of which would require a new synthesis.

Recently, new methods have been developed to tune nanoparticles' SPR after their
synthesis. These approaches can be divided into two broad categories: ($1$) The
first group of methods tune the refractive index of the medium using an electric
or magnetic field\cite{Kossyrev2005}. The advantage of these methods is that the
SPR shift is reproducible and reversible. However the tuning range is rather
limited and the continuous tuning within this range is difficult to achieve.
($2$) The other set of approaches rely on controllably inducing shape
modifications of the nanoparticles to tune the plasmon resonance through
chemical or physical means. For example, thermal reshaping was induced by
illuminating the nanoparticles with an intense, pulsed
\cite{Link2000}\cite{Horiguchi2008} or continuous laser\cite{Yorulmaz2012}.
Increasing the particles' temperature therefore leads to change in shape,
favoring those conformations with a lower surface energy (i.e.
spheres over rods, etc.). Chemical reshaping is also possible and was the focus
of several studies\cite{Carbo-Argibay2007}
\cite{Rodriguez-Fernandez2005} \cite{Jana2002}. In those cases, the capping
agent will induce different reactivities on the sides than on the tips of the
particles; because of a higher curvature\cite{Yuan2015} the the tips are
normally more susceptible to chemical reactions, leading to an anisotropic reshaping
shortening the long axis or softening any high-curvature region. In both cases
(laser or chemical induced reshaping) the outcome is a blue-shift of the surface
resonance peak.

% The chemical reshaping is normally performed in bulk, with the nanoparticles
% dispersed in solution. Another group has studied how the chemical reactivity of
% gold \cite{Ni2012} can be altered by exploiting the plasmon resonance. This is
% achieved mainly through changes in the surrounding temperature; it has to be
% noted that in these experiments the surfactant was present as for the bulk
% experiments. In another work\cite{Tsung2006}, high resolution TEM images allowed
% to show that the crystal structure of individual particles is preserved after
% oxidation inducing a shortening of the long axis of over $10\nm$. A common trend
% in the vast majority of these works is that nanorods tend to reshape into
% spheres, giving rise to a blue shift of the longitudinal plasmon resonance.

Here we present a new approach for precise and in-situ tuning of plasmon
resonances of single gold nanorods isolated and immobilized over a glass
surface. A nanorod's plasmon resonance is tuned over $130\nm$ (starting from
$650\nm$ up to $780\nm$). Our method exploits well known chemistry between gold
and potassium cyanide (KCN), to controllably etch gold atoms from the
nanoparticle and thereby change its aspect ratio. We note that unlike many of
the previous studies, here we observe a red-shift of SPR on gold nanorods.
Our simulations based on the discrete dipole approximation method attributes
this red-shift to symmetric etching of gold nanorods from all sides resulting in
overall increase of aspect ratio. This is in contrary to previous studies, where
the etching was preferred at the tips, resulting in an overall decrease of
aspect ratios. The symmetric etching of gold nanorods is also verified from
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images.

% Our experiments are new in performing both single-particle studies while
% removing the surfactant from the equation. Controlling the concentration of KCN
% allows to fine tune the plasmon peak position of individual particles, without
% hindering the known optical properties of them. Moreover we show that only a few
% thousand molecules of KCN have to react with the nanoparticle in order to cause
% an observable change in the plasmon position.

\section{Experimental method}
\begin{figure}[p]

 \caption{Experimental setup and examples of the observations. A) Simplified
 schematic of the confocal microscope employed during the measurements. B) A

 water, before etching and C) luminescence spectrum of a single rod.}
 \label{fig:setup}
\end{figure}

Gold nanorods were synthesized by following standard seed-growth
method\cite{Nikoobakht2003}. The average size of the nanorods was $60\nm\times
25\nm$ and their SPR is located at $650\nm$ in water (SI figs: SEM image and
bulk extinction of nanorods as synthesized).

Single-particle measurements were done on a home-built confocal microscope
(Figure \ref{fig:setup}). A $532\nm$ laser was used for exciting the particles.
The excitation power was $300\uW$ at the back focal plane of the objective
(Olympus $60\times$, $\textrm{NA}\,0.9$ air). The luminescence signal was then
filtered with two $532\nm$ notch filters and was detected by either an avalanche
photodiode or a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD-spectrometer (Acton $500\textrm{i}$).
The images were acquired by scanning the sample across a tightly focused laser
beam using a XYZ piezo scanning stage (PI Nano Cube).

The samples were prepared by spin casting a suspension of AuNR on clean
coverslips and thoroughly rinsing them  with Milli-Q water and placed in an
ozone cleaner for eliminating the excess of CTAB. Afterwards the samples are
placed in a flow-cell; the initial spectra is taken with the rods immersed in
Milli-Q water (see for example Figure \ref{fig:setup}.c). This initial
characterization allows us to discard clusters of rods\cite{Funston2009}.
Next, a solution of KCN was flowed into the cell with concentrations ranging
from $3\uM$ to $80\uM$. In each case the spectra of approximately $10$
different particles are acquired consecutively after focusing on each one. The
time resolution varies according to the exposure time and number of particles;
in this work a spectra of each particle is taken at least every minute.

\section{Results}

Figure \ref{fig:setup}b shows a typical one-photon-excited luminescence image
of gold nanorods isolated on glass surface and covered with water.
Approximately $90\%$ of the diffraction-limited bright spots originate from
single gold nanorods. This was confirmed by acquiring their luminescence
spectra; a typical result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:setup}c which shows
a narrow Lorentzian lineshape\cite{Funston2009}.

 \label{fig:plasmon_single_rod}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_single_rod}a shows the one-photon luminescence spectra
of a gold nanorod immersed in $20\uM$ KCN at intervals of $70\,\text{s}$. We
clearly observe a gradual red-shift of the nanorod’s plasmon resonance by more
than  $100\nm$ over a time interval of $300\,\text{s}$. This red-shift is also
associated with a decrease of photoluminescence intensity by factor of $4$. A
more detailed analysis shows that the nanorod’s plasmon resonance wavelength
(calculated from fitting with a lorentzian function) varies almost linearly
with respect to time (inset of Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_single_rod}a). We note
the presence of an additional shoulder peak at $650\nm$ ($1.9\,\eV$) which is
more prominent for the less intense curves and is due to Raman scattering of
water\cite{Snow1985} that could not be completely removed when subtracting the
background (see SI for the spectra of the background).

We find the same trend for all the nanorods that were studied. Our results are
summarized in Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_single_rod}b, which shows the shift of
plasmon resonance wavelengths as a function of time for nine different rods
(the dashed lines). Each nanorod shows a red-shift of the plasmon resonance
wavelength which varies almost linearly with time irrespective of their
initial resonance energy. The rate of SPR shift however, varies significantly
from particle to particle, the fastest having a rate of $15\nm/\textrm{minute}$
while the slowest one of $2\nm/\textrm{minute}$. The green curve in Figure
\ref{fig:plasmon_single_rod}b is the average of all the shifts; since the
spectra of each particle were acquired sequentially, we interpolated the
values of the shift at given times with a cubic spline.

The chemistry between gold and potassium cyanide is well known and is being
used for gold mining, electroplating, organic synthesis, etc. Gold reacts with
aqueous KCN in presence oxygen to form $\textrm{Au(CN)}_2^-$, which is soluble
in water. The reaction can be written as follows 
\begin{equation*}
4\textrm{Au} + 8\textrm{KCN}^-+\textrm{O}_2 + 2\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}
\leftrightarrows 4K\textrm{Au(CN)}_2^-+4\textrm{KOH}^- \end{equation*} 
In our experiment formation of $\textrm{Au(CN)}_2^-$ will result in etching of the
gold atoms from the nanorods, as has been reported previously\cite{Jana2002}.

The etching of gold atoms from a nanorod has two effects: Firstly, the
nanorod’s volume will decrease gradually with longer reaction time. This is
consistent with our observation that the one-photon-luminescence intensity
decreases with time. Secondly, the aspect ratio of a nanorod can either
decrease or increase depending on the preferred direction of etching.
Nanorods’ aspect ratio will decrease with time when the reaction happens
preferably from the tips. This is indeed the case for nanorods protected with
CTAB and dispersed in solution\cite{Jana2002}. CTAB binds weakly to the tips
compared to the sides and therefore leaves the tips more susceptible for
chemical reactions\cite{Caswell2003}. The consequent decrease of aspect ratio
yields a blue shift of plasmon resonance\cite{Link1999}. In a second case,
etching happens isotropically from both sides and tips resulting in an overall
increase of the nanorod's aspect ratio. This is the more likely scenario in
our experiment as the nanorods’ surface does not have any protective CTAB bi-
layer.

Numerical simulations based on the discrete dipole approximation model were
performed to further confirm that the red shift of plasmon resonance is indeed
due to isotropic etching of the nanorods. The initial dimensions of the
particles were fixed at $25\nm\times60\nm$ which coincided with the median
dimensions of the distribution of sizes of the nanoparticles (see SI). These
simulations are carried out in steps of $0.5\nm$ for a total of $10\nm$ (i.e.
the minimum particle size is $15\nm\times 50 \nm$). Figure
\ref{fig:simulations}a shows the scattering spectra of the particle at
different etching intervals. We clearly observe a red-shift of the plasmon
resonance wavelength, as was observed in our experiment. The insets of the
figure show the decrease of the integrated scattering spectrum as a function of
the etching and the detailed time-evolution of the SPR obtained from the fitting
of the peaks with a lorentzian function. Both are compatible with the
experimental observations. Furthermore it is possible to fix the etching rate to
best approximate the average plasmon shift. These results are displayed as the
red curve in Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_single_rod}b. The best approximation to
the average is found when the etching rate is set to $1\nm/\textrm{min}$.

 function of the etching. b) Shows the shift rate as a function of the
 initial plasmon resonance. The size of the markers is proportional to the initial volume of the rods.}
 \label{fig:simulations}
\end{figure}

Furthermore the simulations allow to study the different shift rates that were
present in the experimental results. Figure \label{fig:simulations}b shows the
different shift rates as functions of the initial plasmon resonance of the
particles. The shift rate is defined through a linear fit of the plasmon shift
as a function of the amount of etching. The size of the markers of each
particle denote their volume. In this way it is possible to observe that
particles with the same (or similar) volume, have faster shift rates if their
initial aspect ratio is larger (i.e. the SPR is red-shifted.) On the other
hand, particles with a similar initial resonance, show a faster shift if they
are smaller.

 time for particles with the same initial SPR at different KCN concentrations.
 The inset shows the shift rate of these same particles.}
 \label{fig:FWHM}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:FWHM}a shows how the FWHM of the plasmon peak decreases while
the shift increases for several nanorods immersed in $20\uM$ KCN. Note the
units of the plot, since it is not trivial the use of wavelengths for the
FWHM, we show these results in energy scale. At the beginning of the reaction
there is a rapid diminishing of the width. Then a minimum is reached for
shifts between $75\nm$ and $100\nm$.  While the reaction continues, the width
starts to increase; this means that the reshaping at some point will start
having an effect on the shape of the particle. This is often encountered for
shifts above $100\nm$, but of course depends on the particle initial size and
shape. The inset of the Figure shows the FWHM obtained from the simulations
for a $25\nm\times60\nm$ nanorod. The width decreases with the shift slightly
slower than in the experiment but the trend is similar to the observed. 

The faster reduction observed in the experiments may be due to the elimination
of defects from the surface of the particles. However, the overall observed
and simulated decrease of width can be explained considering that both the
radiative and non-radiative damping decrease during the etching process. The
radiation damping scales as the volume of the particle\cite{Wokaun1982} and
therefore will decrease while the cyanide etches gold atoms from the particle.
On the other hand, we observe that the energy distance between the
longitudinal plasmon peak and interband transitions in gold increases during
the etching process. Therefore the non-radiative damping mechanisms in the
particle become less efficient\cite{Sonnichsen2002}. Both effects combined
will therefore have a role in the diminishing plasmon width that is
observed.

Figure \ref{fig:FWHM}b shows the plasmon peak shift as a function of time for
various KCN concentrations for particles with a plasmon peak position of
roughly $630\nm$. As shown for the simulations (Figure
\ref{fig:simulations}b), the initial SPR will have a role on the etching rate,
therefore it is important to choose particles that are similar to each other.
The timetraces of the peak position clearly show that the shift rate is
proportional to the concentration of KCN. This result is also shown in the
inset, where the shift rate is defined as previously and plotted as a function
of the concentration of KCN.

From these results estimating the atomic radius of gold to be $zzzz \nm$ and
adapting the etching model we can estimate the volume, and therefore the
amount of gold atoms, etched per unit of time. For a KCN concentration of
$10\uM$ estimate that the reaction rate can be as low as $700$ atoms per
second. In the experiments performed at $3\uM$ concentration, the particles
chosen didn't have a plasmon close to $630\nm$ and therefore are not shown in
the figure; however if the extrapolation still holds true for this low
concentrations it would yield a rate of just $200$ atoms per second. Inverting
the relationship, the plasmon peak shift while gold reacts with KCN happens at
a rate of roughly $0.5\cdot 10^{-6}\,\textrm{eV}/\textrm{atom}$.

% Every particle can be slightly different from another, not only because of its
% aspect ratio (and plasmon peak position) but also because of the presence of
% surface impurities. This was shown already in Figure \ref{fig:FWHM} where the
% FWHM decreases steeply at the beginning. The distribution of particle sizes and
% aspect ratios will in turn lead to different shift rates that will cause a
% broadening of the peak distribution after etching. These results are for
% particles immobilized on the coverslip and with all the surface capping washed
% out, leading to an isotropic etching. In bulk, where the rods are freely
% difussing and the surfactant is still present, the results are different.

Samples of the same nanorods are prepared for SEM imaging by drop casting the
same solution of rods. The images were acquired before the etching, after
$2\,\textrm{min}$ immersion in KCN and after $4\,\textrm{min}$. Averaging
around $300$ different particles at each interval yields an etching constant
of $0.5\nm/\textrm{minute}$. This is consistent with the optical observations,
not only of the plasmon shift but also of the diminishing intensity as a
function of time. Moreover it confirms the etching estimates given by the
numerical simulations. It has to be noted that when particles are isolated
from each other the shape is preserved; for aggregates of particles this no
longer holds, and rods start to lose their shape (see Supporting Information
for SEM images.) Calculating the distribution of sizes of the particles shows
a slight increase in the aspect ratio but this is obscured by the broad
distribution of values (even before starting the etching).

The same experiments performed in bulk (see SI) show a different behaviour of
the plasmon resonance. As reported by other groups\cite{Jana2002}, the rods
reshape into spheres and this can be explained by the presence of CTAB: the
tips will be more exposed therefore reacting more quickly yielding a net
decrease in aspect ratio. In our single-particle experiments the CTAB was
removed but now there is the glass surface supporting the rods that has to be
taken into account. In principle there is a side of the rods in contact with
the surface that will be less exposed to KCN; the etching in this case
wouldn't be isotropic and would flatten the rods. Nor the optical nor the SEM
images allow us to assess this question because there is no information on the
third axis (perpendicular to the surface). Experiments performed in an optical
tweezer away from the surface as done in Ref \cite{Ni2012} but without the
capping agent would involve in addition the use of microfluidics and therefore
are much harder to perform.

\section{Conclusions}

In this work we have shown a simple method that allows us to tune the plasmon
peak position of single gold nanorods with nanometer accuracy and over the
range of $100\nm$ ($300\meV$). More importantly, it is shown that during the
etching process the rodlike shape is preserved; this was confirmed both by
monitoring the FWHM of the resonance peak and by acquiring SEM images after
different reaction times. The experiments allowed us to record the plasmon
peak with a relatively high temporal and spectral accuracy, allowing us to
stop the reaction when the resonance is at the desired value.

The ADDA simulations with the isotropic etching model allowed us to estimate
the amount of gold being etched from the nanoparticles. They were consistent
in both predicting the red-shift of the plasmon and the diminishing intensity
of the luminescence signal. SEM images of the rods confirmed the values
obtained from the simulations. Combining these results provide a way of
predicting the behaviour of the plasmon peak for different rods.

We observed a broad distribution of the rate at which the plasmon peak shifts
for different particles under the same experimental conditions. This can be
attributed to the initial aspect ratios and volumes of each particle. Sphere-
like particles will show a small shift due to the fact that the aspect ratio
is constant while under isotropic etching. The more elongated particles, on
the other hand, will have a much steeper increase in aspect ratio while being
etched. Also intrinsic differences between the particles, for instance the
faceting of the surface, or the prescence of left over CTAB that was not
completely washed away can also cause different results and are much harder to
quantify.

The role of the capping agent has largely been studied and has always been
held responsible for the observations both in chemical etching\cite{Yuan2015}
and for photothermal reshaping\cite{Horiguchi2008}. Avoiding the presence of
the passivating layers is impossible in suspension, since gold nanoparticles
would aggregate. Our results provide evidence that supports previous
observations regarding the effect of the curvature and the accessibility of
KCN to the surface of the particle. 



% A simple approximation of the reaction rates show that the dissolution of just a
% few thousand atoms in the gold nanoparticle is enough for detecting a change in
% the luminescence spectra. This method is not aimed at pushing the detection limits
% of KCN (or other substances) via plasmonic structures, but still has proven to
% be highly efficient. A better approach to sense plasmon shifts is to detect
% changes in the cross section at the plasmon wing (via scattering or
% photothermal detection, for instance). 

% The report by Wei et Al. in 2012 \cite{Wei2012} shows these ideas but in a
% slightly different condition. They found sensitivities to the presence of KCN in
% the order of the nM. We have readily approached this threshold and believe that
% the sensitivity of single particles to very low concentrations (in the order or
% below the nM) should be higher, specially if using smaller particles with a
% higher aspect ratio.

% Combining this results with the catalytic properties of gold and the presence of
