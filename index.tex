\abstract{Single-gold nanorods exhibit great opportunities for bio-sensing, enhanced spectroscopies and photothermal
therapy. A key property of this particles is the surface plasmon resonance, that is strongly dependent on their shape. Methods for tuning this resonance after the synthesis of the particles are of great interests for many such applications. In this work we show that through very well known chemistry between gold atoms and cyanide ions it is possible to tune the surface plasmon of single $25\times50\nm$ rods by more than $100\nm$ towards longer wavelengths. This is achieved by slowly etching gold atoms from the surface of the particles, preserving their well known optical properties.}

\section{Introduction}

Gold nanoparticles exhibit enhanced absorption and scattering cross sections with resonances ranging from the visible to the near infra red. This property is closely related to the surface plasmon, a collective oscillation of conduction electrons that depends on the shape of the particles. For gold nanorods (AuNR) the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) wavelength depends on the aspect ratio (AR) of the particle and can be found between $550\nm$ for spheres with AR of $1$ to beyond $800\nm$ for elongated particles.

The surface plasmon presents great opportunities in (bio-)
sensing\cite{Zijlstra2012}, enhanced spectroscopies\cite{Sivapalan2013},
photothermal therapy\cite{Zhao2014} and for concentrating light below the
diffraction limit\cite{Zijlstra2011}. Success in many of these applications
requires precise and in situ control over the nanoparticles' plasmon resonance
energy. For example, maximum fluorescence\cite{Khatua2014} or Raman
enhancement\cite{McFarland2005} is achieved when the nanoparticles' plasmon
resonance is tuned to the excitation laser wavelength. As another example, efficient photothermal
therapy requires the nanoparticles' SPR to be tuned to NIR to minimize the
damage to healthy cells\cite{Alkilany2012}.

Typically the SPR is tuned by carefully manipulating the shapes of nanoparticles during their synthesis. Particularly useful are the rod-shaped particles, whose resonance can be found between $600\nm$ and even over $1000\nm$ depending on their aspect ratios. Adjusting the concentrations of gold-seed and silver nitrate during the seed-mediated growth synthesis method\cite{Vigderman2012} is the usual way for producing particles with different resonances. Many other nanoparticles shapes such as nanoprisms, nanorice, nanocubes, nanoshells, etc. have been synthesized with their plasmon resonances covering the entire spectral range from visible to near-IR\cite{Lal2007}. Wet-chemical synthesis methods, however, generally yield a broad distribution in nanoparticle sizes and/or shapes, hindering precise and reproducible experiments that need a particular resonance. Furthermore, these methods do not provide any in-situ adjustment of the SPR any change of which requires a new
synthesis.

Recently, new methods have been developed to tune nanoparticles' SPR after their
synthesis. These approaches can be divided into two broad categories: ($1$) The
first group of methods tune the refractive index of the medium using an electric
or magnetic field\cite{Kossyrev2005}. The advantage of these methods is that the
SPR shift is reproducible and reversible. However the tuning range is rather
limited and continuous tuning within this range is difficult to achieve.
($2$) The other set of approaches rely on controllably inducing shape
modifications of the nanoparticles to tune the plasmon resonance through
chemical or physical means. For example, thermal reshaping was induced by
illuminating the nanoparticles with an intense, pulsed
\cite{Link2000}\cite{Horiguchi2008} or continuous laser\cite{Yorulmaz2012}.
Increasing the particles' temperature therefore leads to changes in shape,
favoring those conformations with a lower surface energy (i.e.
spheres over rods, etc.). Chemical reshaping is also possible and was the focus
of several studies\cite{Carbo-Argibay2007}
\cite{Rodriguez-Fernandez2005} \cite{Jana2002}. In those cases, the capping
agent will induce different reactivities on the sides than on the tips of the
particles; because of a higher curvature\cite{Yuan2015} the tips are
normally more susceptible to chemical reactions, leading to an anisotropic reshaping
shortening the long axis or softening any high-curvature region. Both in the case
 of laser or chemical induced reshaping the outcome is a blue-shift of the surface
resonance peak.

In this work we present a new approach for precise and in-situ tuning of plasmon
resonances of single gold nanorods isolated and immobilized over a glass
surface. A nanorod's plasmon resonance is tuned over $130\nm$, starting from
$650\nm$ up to $780\nm$. Our method exploits well known chemistry between gold
and potassium cyanide (KCN) to controllably etch gold atoms from the
nanoparticle and thereby change its aspect ratio. We note that unlike many of
the previous studies, here we observe a SPR red shift on gold nanorods. We also verified the resuts from scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the particles and by simulations based on the discrete dipole approximation method. Contrary to previous works where the etching was preferred at the tips, we attribute the red shift to isotropic etching of gold nanorods from all sides resulting in an increase of aspect ratio.

\section{Experimental method}

 schematic of the confocal microscope employed during the measurements. b) A

 \label{fig:setup}
\end{figure}

Gold nanorods were synthesized by following standard seeded growth
methods\cite{Nikoobakht2003}. The average size of the nanorods was $50\nm\times
25\nm$ and their SPR is located at $650\nm$ in water (refer to the
supplementary material for the SEM image and bulk extinction of nanorods as
synthesized).

Single-particle measurements were done on a home-built confocal microscope
(Figure \ref{fig:setup}a). A $532\nm$ laser was used for exciting the particles.
The excitation power was $300\uW$ at the back aperture of the objective
(Olympus $60\times$, $\textrm{NA}\,0.9$ air). The luminescence signal was then
filtered with two $532\nm$ notch filters and was detected by either an avalanche
photodiode or a liquid nitrogen cooled CCD-spectrometer (Acton $500\textrm{i}$).
The images were acquired by scanning the sample across the tightly focused laser
beam using a XYZ piezo scanning stage (PI Nano Cube). Figure \ref{fig:setup}b shows a typical result from a raster scan. Each bright spot corresponds to a single nanoparticle.

Samples were prepared by spin casting a suspension of AuNR on clean
coverslips and thoroughly rinsing them with Milli-Q water and placed in an
ozone cleaner at least for one hour to eliminate the excess of CTAB. Afterwards the samples were
mounted on a flowcell and the initial spectra were taken with the rods immersed in
Milli-Q water. Figure \ref{fig:setup}c shows an example of the luminescence spectra of a single particle. Having an initial
characterization allowed us to discard clusters of rods\cite{Funston2009} from the study.
Next, a solution of KCN was flowed with concentrations ranging
from $3\uM$ to $80\uM$. In each case the spectra of approximately $10$
different particles were acquired consecutively after focusing on each one. The
time resolution varies according to the exposure time and number of particles;
in this work a spectra of each particle was taken at least every minute.

\section{Results}

Figure \ref{fig:setup}b shows a typical one-photon-excited luminescence image
of gold nanorods isolated on a glass surface and covered with water. Single particle spectra has a narrow lorentzian lineshape\cite{Funston2009} while clusters show additional peaks or a broad spectrum. Figure \ref{fig:setup}c shows a typical spectrum originating from a single nanoparticle. In the samples analyzed more than $90\%$ of the diffraction-limited bright spots originate from single gold nanorods.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_single_rod}a shows the one-photon luminescence spectra
of a gold nanorod immersed in $20\uM$ KCN at intervals of $70\,\text{s}$. We
clearly observe a gradual red-shift of the nanorod's plasmon resonance by more
than $100\nm$ over a time interval of $300\,\text{s}$. This red-shift is also
associated with a decrease of photoluminescence intensity by factor of $4$.
Fitting each spectrum with a lorentzian function allows to extract the resonance
wavelength at each recorded instant. A more detailed analysis shows that the
nanorod's plasmon resonance wavelength varies almost linearly with respect to
time as is shown in the inset of Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_single_rod}a. We note the presence of an
additional shoulder peak at $650\nm$ ($1.9\,\eV$) which is more prominent for
the less intense curves and is due to Raman scattering of water\cite{Snow1985}
that could not be completely removed when subtracting the background (see SI for
the spectra of the background).

We find the same trend for all the nanorods that were studied. Our results are
summarized in Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_single_rod}b, which shows the shift of
plasmon resonance wavelengths as a function of time for nine different rods
(dashed lines). Each nanorod shows a red-shift of the plasmon resonance
wavelength which varies almost linearly with time irrespective of their
initial resonance wavelength. The rate of SPR shift, however, varies significantly
from particle to particle. The highest observed rate was $15\nm/\textrm{minute}$
while the lowest one was $2\nm/\textrm{minute}$. The green curve in Figure
\ref{fig:plasmon_single_rod}b is the average of all the shifts; since the
spectra of each particle were acquired sequentially, we interpolated the
values of the shift at intermediate times with a cubic spline.

The reaction between gold and potassium cyanide is well known and is being used
for gold mining, electroplating, etc. Gold reacts with
aqueous CN$^-$ ions in presence of oxygen to form $\textrm{Au(CN)}_2^-$, which
is soluble in water. The reaction can be written as follows
\begin{equation*}
4\textrm{Au} + 8\textrm{CN}^-+\textrm{O}_2 + 2\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}
\leftrightarrows 4\textrm{Au(CN)}_2^-+4\textrm{OH}^- \end{equation*}
In our experiment the formation of $\textrm{Au(CN)}_2^-$ results in gold etching from the nanorods, as has been reported previously\cite{Jana2002}.

The etching of gold atoms from a nanorod has two effects: Firstly, the
nanorods' volume will decrease gradually with longer reaction time. This is
consistent with our observation that the one-photon-luminescence intensity
decreases with time. Secondly, the aspect ratio of a nanorod can either
decrease or increase depending on the preferred direction of etching.
Nanorod aspect ratio will decrease with time when the reaction happens
preferably at the tips. This is indeed the case for nanorods protected with
CTAB and dispersed in solution\cite{Jana2002}. CTAB binds weakly to the tips
compared to the sides and therefore leaves the tips more susceptible for
chemical reactions\cite{Caswell2003}. The consequent decrease of aspect ratio
yields a blue shift of the plasmon resonance\cite{Link1999}. In a second case,
etching happens isotropically from both sides and tips resulting in an overall
increase of the nanorod's aspect ratio. This is the more likely scenario in
our experiment as the nanorods' surface does not have any protective CTAB bilayer.

Numerical simulations based on the discrete dipole approximation were
performed to further confirm that the red shift of the plasmon resonance is
indeed due to isotropic etching of the nanorods. The initial dimensions of the
particles were fixed at $25\nm\times50\nm$ which coincided with the median
dimensions of the distribution of sizes of the nanoparticles (see SI). Simulations are carried out in etching steps of $0.5\nm$ for a total length reduction of $10\nm$, i.e.
the minimum particle size is $15\nm\times 40 \nm$. Figure
\ref{fig:simulations}a shows the calculated scattering spectra of the particle at
different etching intervals. We clearly observe a red-shift of the plasmon
resonance wavelength, in concordance with what was observed in our experiment. The insets of the
figure show the decrease of the integrated scattering spectrum as a function of
the etching and the detailed time-evolution of the SPR obtained from the fitting
of the peaks with a lorentzian function. Both results are compatible with the
experimental observations. Furthermore, it is possible to fix the etching rate to
best approximate the average plasmon shift. These results are displayed as the
red curve in Figure \ref{fig:plasmon_single_rod}b. Setting the etching rate to $1\nm/\textrm{min}$ gives the best approximation to the average.

 the curves obtained at different simulations steps. The black curves are
 fittings with lorentzians. The insets show the intensity and the SPR as
 functions of the etching. b) Shift rate as a function of the initial
 plasmon resonance and volume of the particles. As expected from an isotropic etching, larger particles will present a slower plasmon shift and more elongated particles will have a faster aspect ratio increase.}
 \label{fig:simulations}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:simulations}b shows different plasmon shift rates as a function of the initial plasmon resonance for different
particles. Each line corresponds to a different initial volume, the smallest corresponding to particles with dimensions $33\nm\times18\nm$, the largest to $74\nm\times22\nm$ and the intermediate to $50\nm\times25\nm$. The etching step in these simulations was set to $2\nm$ to increase computational efficiency. It can be observed that for larger particles the shift is slower than for smaller ones at the same initial resonance. On the other hand it is also possible to observe that red shifted particles present a faster shift rate.

Since the plasmon resonance is closely related to the aspect ratio $L/D$, i.e. the length divided by the diameter of the particle, a larger change in the latter implies a larger change of the first. Small particles therefore, will exhibit a bigger change in aspect ratio when subjected to the same amount of etching than bigger particles. The same is true for particles that already have larger aspect ratios. This variability in shift rates can account for the big variability observed experimentally. It also shows that possible sensing applications will benefit from the use of red-shifted particles without compromising the signal collected.

 simulations carried out with the ADDA package. b) SPR Shift as a function of
 time for particles with the same initial SPR at different KCN concentrations.}
 \label{fig:FWHM}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:FWHM}a shows how the FWHM of the plasmon peak decreases while the shift increases for several nanorods immersed in $20\uM$ KCN. Note that the plot shows the width of the resonance in units of energy and not in units of wavelength. Because of the nonlinear relation between them, the peak width expressed in wavelength depends on the peak position rendering impossible the comparison of widths during the shift. At the beginning of the reaction there is a rapid diminishing of the width. Then a minimum is reached for shifts between $75\nm$ and $100\nm$. After this point the volume of the particles is largely reduced making it no longer possible to reliably extract information from the spectra. The inset of the Figure shows the FWHM obtained from the simulations for a $25\nm\times50\nm$ nanorod. The width decreases with the shift slightly slower than in the experiment but the trend is similar to the observed one.

The faster decrease of the resonance FWHM observed in the experiments as
compared to the simulations may be due to the elimination of defects from the
surface of the particles. However, the overall observed and simulated decrease
of width can be explained considering that both the radiative and non-radiative
damping mechanisms decrease during the etching process. The radiation damping scales as the
volume of the particle\cite{Wokaun1982} and therefore will decrease while the
cyanide etches gold atoms from the particle.
On the other hand we observe that the energy distance between the longitudinal
plasmon peak and interband transitions in gold increases during the etching
process. Therefore the non-radiative damping mechanisms in the particle become
less efficient\cite{Sonnichsen2002}. These effects combined can account for the diminishing plasmon width that is observed.

Figure \ref{fig:FWHM}b shows the plasmon peak shift as a function of time for
various KCN concentrations for particles with a plasmon peak position of
roughly $630\nm$. As shown for the simulations (Figure
\ref{fig:simulations}b), the initial SPR will have a role on the etching rate,
therefore it is important to choose particles that are similar to each other.
The time-traces of the peak position clearly show that the shift rate is
proportional to the concentration of KCN. It is important to note that the
behavior of the FWHM in all the cases is similar and it resembles the results
shown in Figure \ref{fig:FWHM}a. This means that the shift rate does not have an
effect on the quality of the plasmon resonance.

By fitting the simulations to the experimental results it is possible to
estimate the volume of gold etched away from a particle by unit of time.
Assuming an atomic radius of gold of $144\,\textrm{pm}$\cite{Pauling1947} we
obtain that for a KCN concentration of $10\uM$ the reaction rate can be as low
as $700$ atoms per second. From the simulations and these estimates it is
possible to approximate the plasmon shift for every etched atom. In the same
conditions as before, it would be $0.2\cdot 10^{-3}\, \textrm{nm}/
\textrm{atom}$, several orders of magnitude smaller that the sensitivity
of our experiments.

Samples of the same nanorods are prepared for SEM imaging by drop casting the
same solution of rods. The images were acquired before the etching, after
$2\,\textrm{min}$ immersion in KCN and after $4\,\textrm{min}$. In each case we
observed that when particles are isolated from each other, the rod-shape is
preserved. In aggregates of particles this no longer holds and rods start to
lose their shape (see Supporting Information for SEM images.) Calculating the
distribution of sizes of the particles shows a slight increase in the aspect
ratio but this is obscured by the broad distribution of values, even before
starting the etching.

The same experiments performed in bulk (see SI) show a different behavior of
the plasmon resonance. As reported by other groups \cite{Jana2002}
\cite{Yuan2015} the rods reshape into spheres. The presence of CTAB can explain this trend: the tips will be more exposed and therefore react more quickly, yielding a net decrease in aspect ratio. In our single-particle
experiments CTAB was removed both by rinsing the samples with water and by placing them in an ozon cleaner. There is however the glass surface supporting the rods that has to be taken into account. In principle there is a side of the
rods in contact with the surface that will be less exposed to KCN. Etching
in this case wouldn't be isotropic and would flatten the rods. Neither the
optical nor the SEM images allowed us to assess this question because there is
no information on the axis perpendicular to the surface. Experiments performed
in an optical tweezer away from the surface as done in Ref \cite{Ni2012} but
without the capping agent would involve in addition the use of microfluidics and
therefore are much harder to perform.

\section{Conclusions}
In this work we have shown a simple method that allowed us to tune the plasmon
peak position of single gold nanorods with nanometer accuracy and over the
range of $100\nm$ ($300\meV$). More importantly, we show that during the
etching process the rod-like shape is preserved; this was confirmed both by
monitoring the FWHM of the resonance peak and by acquiring SEM images after
different reaction times. The experiments allowed us to record the plasmon
peak with a relatively high temporal and spectral accuracy, allowing to
stop the reaction when the resonance is at the desired value.

Discrete dipole simulations with an isotropic etching model allowed us to estimate the amount of gold etched from the nanoparticles. The calculations were consistent with the red-shift of the plasmon and the diminishing intensity of the luminescence signal. The general trend of the FWHM is also correctly reproduced, but the obtained values are slightly different. SEM images of the rods confirmed the values obtained from the simulations. Combining these results provide a way of predicting the behaviour of the plasmon peak for different rods.

We observed a broad distribution of the rate at which the plasmon peak shifts
for different particles under the same experimental conditions. This can be
attributed to the initial differences in aspect ratios and volumes of each particle. Sphere-
like particles will show a small shift since the aspect ratio
is constant while under isotropic etching. More elongated particles, on
the other hand, will have a much steeper increase in aspect ratio while being
etched. There can also be present intrinsic differences between the particles that can produce different shift rates even if particles are geometrically identical. For instance the faceting of the surface or the prescence of left over CTAB that was not completely washed away can induce a slightly anisotropic etching and are much harder to quantify.

The role of the capping agent has largely been studied and has always been
held responsible for the observations both in chemical etching\cite{Yuan2015}
and for photothermal reshaping\cite{Horiguchi2008}. Avoiding the presence of
the passivating layers is impossible in suspension, since gold nanoparticles
would aggregate. Our results provide evidence that supports previous
observations regarding the effect of the curvature and the accessibility of
KCN to the surface of the particle.
