
The other image displays the behavior when rods are in contact
with each other.
When not all the faces of the rod are equally accessible the shape is disturbed.
It is possible to observe that the AuNR preserve the shape while diminishing the
volume and increasing the aspect ratio.
Nevertheless this changes are inside the standard distribution of each
parameter. Table \ref{tab:SEM_results} summarizes the averaged values found
after analyzing approximately $300$ particles. However the small shift in the
average is consistent with the optical results, yielding an etching rate of
$0.5\,\textrm{nm}/\min$.
