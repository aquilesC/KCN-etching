abstract = {Design of nanoparticles for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) within suspensions is more involved than simply maximizing the local field enhancement. The enhancement at the nanoparticle surface and the extinction of both the incident and scattered light during propagation act in concert to determine the observed signal intensity. Here we explore these critical aspects of signal generation and propagation through experiment and theory. We synthesized gold nanorods of six different aspect ratios in order to obtain longitudinal surface plasmon resonances that incrementally spanned 600-800 nm. The Raman reporter molecule methylene blue was trap-coated near the surface of each nanorod sample, generating SERS spectra, which were used to compare Raman signals. The average number of reporter molecules per nanorod was quantified against known standards using electrospray ionization liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The magnitude of the observed Raman signal is reported for each aspect ratio along with the attenuation due to extinction in suspension. The highest Raman signal was obtained from the nanorod suspension with a plasmon resonance blue-shifted from the laser excitation wavelength. This finding is in contrast to SERS measurements obtained from molecules dried onto the surface of roughened or patterned metal substrates where the maximum observed signal is near or red-shifted from the laser excitation wavelength. We explain these results as a competition between SERS enhancement and extinction, at the excitation and scattered wavelengths, on propagation through the sample.},

abstract = {Electrochemically prepared Au nanorods were used as seeds for the overgrowth of thin shells of gold, silver, and palladium by using a mild reducing agent, ascorbic acid, in the presence of surfactants at ambient condition. The unique crystal facets of the starting nanorods results in anisotropic crystal overgrowth. The overgrowth rates along different crystallographical directions can be further regulated by adding foreign ions or by using different metal reduction methods. This overgrowth study provides insights on how different metal ions could be reduced preferentially on different Au nanorod surfaces, so that the composition, aspect ratio, shape, and facet of the resulting nanostructures can be rationally tuned. These surfactant-stabilized bimetallic Au(core)M(shell) (M=Au, Ag, Pd) nanorod colloids might serve as better substrates in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy as well as exhibiting enhanced catalytic properties.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of plasmon-induced transparency holds immense potential for high sensitivity sensors and optical information processing due to the extreme dispersion and slowing of light within a narrow spectral window. Unfortunately plasmonic metamaterials demonstrating this effect has been restricted to infrared and greater wavelengths due to requisite precision in structure fabrication. Here we report a novel metamaterial synthesized by bottom-up self-assembly of gold nanorods. The small dimensions (≤ 50/20 nm, length/diameter), atomically smooth surfaces, and nanometer resolution enable the first demonstration of plasmon-induced transparency at visible wavelengths. The slow-down factors within the reduced symmetry heterodimer cluster are comparable to longer wavelength counterparts. The inherent spectral tunability and facile large-scale integration afforded by self-assembled metamaterials will open a new paradigm for physically realizable on-chip photonic device designs.},

abstract = {We developed two simple, rapid, and cost-effective fluorescent nanosensors, both featuring bovine serum albumin labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC))-capped gold nanoparticles (FITC-BSA-Au NPs), for the selective sensing of cyanide (CN(-)) and iodine (I(-)) ions in high-salinity solutions and edible salt samples. During the preparation of FITC-BSA-Au NP probes, when AuNPs were introduced to the mixture containing FITC and BSA, the unconjugated FITC and FITC-labeled BSA (FITC-BSA) adsorbed to the particles' surfaces. These probes operated on a basic principle that I(-) and CN(-) deposited on the surfaces of the Au NPs or the etching of Au NPs induced the release of FITC molecules or FITC-BSA into the solution, and thus restored the florescence of FITC. We employed FITC-BSA to protect the Au NPs from significant aggregation in high-salinity solutions. In the presence of masking agents such as S(2)O(8)(2-)/Pb(2+), FITC-BSA-Au NPs facilitated the selective detection of CN(-) (by at least 150-fold in comparison with other anions). We also demonstrated that the FITC-BSA-Au NPs in the presence of H(2)O(2) could selectively detect I(-) down to 50 nM. Taking advantages of their high stability and selectivity, we employed our FITC-BSA-Au NP-based probes for the detection of CN(-) and I(-) in water samples (pond water, tap water, and seawater) and detection of I(-) in edible salt samples, respectively. This simple, rapid, and cost-effective sensing system appears to demonstrate immense practical potential for the detection of anions in real samples.},

abstract = {Plasmon enhancement of optical properties is both fundamentally important and appealing for many biological and photonic applications. Although metal-enhanced two-photon excitation fluorescence has been demonstrated in the solid substrates, there is no report on metal enhanced overall two-photon excitation fluorescence in the colloid system. Here we systematically investigated gold nanorod enhanced one- and two-photon excitation fluorescence of a porphyrin molecule, T790. The separation distance between the metal core and T790 was varied by adjusting the silica shell thickness from 13 to 42 nm. One- and two-photon excitation fluorescence intensities of T790 were found to strongly depend on the thickness of silica shell that separates gold nanorod and T790. The optimum one- and two-photon excitation fluorescence enhancement was found to occur at shell thicknesses of 34 and 20 nm, with enhancement factors of 2.1 and 11.8, respectively. Fluorescence lifetime of T790 steadily decreased as the shell thickness decreased. The observed two-photon excitation fluorescence enhancement is ascribed to a combination effect of local electric field amplification and competition between increased radiative and non-radiative decay rates. Core-shell nanoparticles that displayed enhanced two-photon excitation fluorescence were also found to exhibit significantly improved singlet oxygen generation capability under two-photon excitation. The applications of these nanoparticles as effective agents for two-photon cell imaging and nano-photosensitizers for two-photon photodynamic therapy with improved efficiency have also been demonstrated in HepG2 cancer cells. The combined advantages of enhanced two-photon excitation fluorescence and two-photon induced singlet oxygen generation make these core-shell nanoparticles as attractive agents for two-photon imaging guided two-photon photodynamic therapy.},

The etching process effectively makes the surface tension isotropic, so that spheres are favored under quasi-static conditions. It is scalable up to particle sizes of 200 nm or more. The resulting spherical crystals display uniform scattering spectra and consistent optical coupling at small separations, even showing Fano-like resonances in small clusters. The high monodispersity of the particles we demonstrate should facilitate the self-assembly of nanoparticle clusters with uniform optical resonances, which could in turn be used to fabricate optical metafluids. Narrow size distributions are required to control not only the spectral features but also the morphology and yield of clusters in certain assembly schemes.},

abstract = {The open-source code ADDA is described, which implements the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), a method to simulate light scattering by finite 3D objects of arbitrary shape and composition. Besides standard sequential execution, ADDA can run on a multiprocessor distributed-memory system, parallelizing a single DDA calculation. Hence the size parameter of the scatterer is in principle limited only by total available memory and computational speed. ADDA is written in C99 and is highly portable. It provides full control over the scattering geometry (particle morphology and orientation, and incident beam) and allows one to calculate a wide variety of integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities (cross sections, the Mueller matrix, etc.). Moreover, ADDA incorporates a range of state-of-the-art DDA improvements, aimed at increasing the accuracy and computational speed of the method. We discuss both physical and computational aspects of the DDA simulations and provide a practical introduction into performing such simulations with the ADDA code. We also present several simulation results, in particular, for a sphere with size parameter 320 (100-wavelength diameter) and refractive index 1.05.},

abstract = {Existing methods for the optical detection of single molecules require the molecules to absorb light to produce fluorescence or direct absorption signals. This limits the range of species that can be detected, because most molecules are purely refractive. Metal nanoparticles or dielectric resonators can be used to detect non-absorbing molecules because local changes in the refractive index produce a resonance shift. However, current approaches only detect single molecules when the resonance shift is amplified by a highly polarizable label or by a localized precipitation reaction on the surface of a nanoparticle. Without such amplification, single-molecule events can only be identified in a statistical way. Here, we report the plasmonic detection of single molecules in real time without the need for labelling or amplification. Our sensor consists of a single gold nanorod coated with biotin receptors, and the binding of single proteins is detected by monitoring the plasmon resonance of the nanorod with a sensitive photothermal assay. The sensitivity of our device is ∼700 times higher than state-of-the-art plasmon sensors and is intrinsically limited by spectral diffusion of the surface plasmon resonance.},

@article{Guffey2011,
abstract = {We demonstrate the plasmon-selective and driven deposition of (bipyramidal) Au nanoparticles on transparent substrates (glass coverslips) utilizing total internal reflection (TIR) illumination. Near-IR laser light undergoing TIR at a glass-water interface causes colloidal Au bipyramids to irreversibly deposit onto the glass surface. We demonstrate that the deposition process has particle (i.e., shape) selectivity that is associated with resonant plasmon excitation. Specifically, the deposition is selective for the bipyramids over spheroidal particles that are also present in solution due to the former's surface plasmon resonance in the near-IR region. Our measurements, finite difference time domain simulations, and the results of an analytical model show that the optical (i.e., scattering and gradient) forces that act on the particles are large and cause the observed acceleration and directed motion of the bipyramids. These directional forces play a major role in the spatial pattern of particle deposition that is observed. In addition, the resonant photothermal heating of the Au bipyramids causes an irreversible loss in colloidal stability, thus allowing them to adhere to the surface. Structural (i.e., scanning electron microscopy) characterization of the deposited bipyramids reveals a slight reduction in aspect ratio relative to the ensemble, consistent with the proposed (heating) mechanism. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of the plasmon-selective deposition of metal nanoparticles from a heterogeneous mixture.},

abstract = {We report a novel technique for long-term parallel three dimensional (3D)-tracking of gold nanorods in live cells with nanometer resolution. Gold nanorods feature a strong plasmon-enhanced two-photon luminescence, can be easily functionalized, and have been shown to be nontoxic. These properties make gold nanorods very suitable for in vivo two-photon luminescence microscopy. By rapid multifocal scanning, we combine the advantages of 3D molecular tracking methods using wide-field imaging with the advantages of two-photon microscopy. Isolated gold nanorods can be localized with a resolution of 4 nm in the xy-plane and 8 nm in the z-direction. The polarization-dependence of the two-photon luminescence signal can be used to resolve the angular orientation, even when two gold nanorods are separated by less than the diffraction limit. Individual nanorods in live U2OS cells could be followed in 3 dimensions for over 30 min, with a photon noise limited accuracy, and a time resolution of 50 ms in 2D and 500 ms in 3D.},

abstract = {We report on the deposition of individual gold nanorods from an optical trap using two different laser wavelengths. Laser light, not being resonant to the plasmon resonances of the nanorods, is used for stable trapping and in situ alignment of individual nanorods. Laser light, being resonant to the transversal mode of the nanorods, is used for depositing nanorods at desired locations. The power and polarization dependence of the process is investigated and discussed in terms of force balances between gradient and scattering forces, plasmonic heating, and rotational diffusion of the nanorods. This two-color approach enables faster printing than its one-color equivalent and provides control over the angular orientation (±16°) and location of the deposited nanorods at the single-nanorod level.},
