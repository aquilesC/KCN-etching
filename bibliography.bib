  abstract={The scattering from metal nanoparticles near their localized plasmon resonance is a promising way of increasing the light absorption in thin-film solar cells. Enhancements in photocurrent have been observed for a wide range of semiconductors and solar cell configurations. We review experimental and theoretical progress that has been made in recent years, describe the basic mechanisms at work, and provide an outlook on future prospects in this area.}

  abstract={Ultrasmooth, highly spherical monocrystalline gold particles were prepared by a cyclic process of slow growth followed by slow chemical etching, which selectively removes edges and vertices. The etching process effectively makes the surface tension isotropic, so that spheres are favored under quasi-static conditions. It is scalable up to particle sizes of 200 nm or more. The resulting spherical crystals display uniform scattering spectra and consistent optical coupling at small separations, even showing Fano-like resonances in small clusters. The high monodispersity of the particles we demonstrate should facilitate the self-assembly of nanoparticle clusters with uniform optical resonances, which could in turn be used to fabricate optical metafluids. Narrow size distributions are required to control not only the spectral features but also the morphology and yield of clusters in certain assembly schemes.},

  abstract={The phenomenon of plasmon-induced transparency holds immense potential for high sensitivity sensors and optical information processing due to the extreme dispersion and slowing of light within a narrow spectral window. Unfortunately plasmonic metamaterials demonstrating this effect has been restricted to infrared and greater wavelengths due to requisite precision in structure fabrication. Here we report a novel metamaterial synthesized by bottom-up self-assembly of gold nanorods. The small dimensions (\&\#x2264; 50/20 nm, length/diameter), atomically smooth surfaces, and nanometer resolution enable the first demonstration of plasmon-induced transparency at visible wavelengths. The slow-down factors within the reduced symmetry heterodimer cluster are comparable to longer wavelength counterparts. The inherent spectral tunability and facile large-scale integration afforded by self-assembled metamaterials will open a new paradigm for physically realizable on-chip photonic device designs.},
